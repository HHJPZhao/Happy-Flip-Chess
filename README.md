Happy Flip Chess - Official Rulebook
Object of the Game
To outscore your opponent by capturing their pieces. The game ends when one player is eliminated or no legal moves can be made, at which point the player with the highest score from their remaining pieces on the board wins.

1. Game Setup

1.1. The Board: The game is played on a half-sized chessboard, consisting of 4 rows and 8 columns (32 squares).
1.2. The Pieces: The game uses a full, standard set of 32 chess pieces (16 white and 16 black).
1.3. Preparation: All 32 pieces are shuffled together and placed randomly on each of the 32 squares, face-down. At the start, neither player knows the location of any piece.
2. How to Play

2.1. Starting Player: The two players first decide who will go first. This can be done by any random method, such as flipping a coin, rolling a die, or playing Rock-Paper-Scissors (&lt;em>jiangjunbao&lt;/em>). This player will be referred to as Player 1.

2.2. The First Turn (Color Selection):

Player 1 begins the game by choosing any single face-down piece on the board and flipping it face-up.
The color of this revealed piece (White or Black) is assigned to Player 2.
Player 1 is then assigned the opposite color for the rest of the game.
Player 1's first turn is now over. The turn passes to Player 2 to make the first move.
2.3. A Regular Turn: After the first turn, players take turns moving one of their revealed pieces on the board.

3. Movement and Capture

3.1. Standard Moves: All pieces move and capture exactly as they do in a normal chess game.
3.2. The Golden Rule: You can only interact with face-up pieces.
You may only move your own colored pieces that are already face-up.
You may only capture an opponent's piece that is already face-up.
Face-down ("unflipped") pieces cannot be captured and act as blockers on the board.
4. Special Rules

4.1. No Check or Checkmate: The King can be captured like any other piece. There is no concept of "check" or "checkmate."
4.2. No Pawn Promotion: When a Pawn reaches the opposite side of the board, it is not promoted. It simply remains a Pawn and can continue to move if a legal move is available.
5. Ending the Game

The game ends immediately when one of the following conditions is met:

Elimination: One player has no pieces left on the board.
No Legal Moves: The player whose turn it is has no legal moves they can make.
6. Winning and Scoring

6.1. How to Win: As soon as the game ends, both players count the scores of all their pieces remaining on the board. The player with the higher total score is the winner.
6.2. Piece Scores:
Queen: 17 points
Rook: 11 points
King: 8 points
Bishop: 6 points
Knight: 5 points
